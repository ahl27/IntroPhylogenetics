Welcome to my tutorial on phylogenetics! This is designed to be a ground-up explanation
of common methods used for phylogenetics, including building and comparing phylogenetic
trees. I'm setting this tutorial up as an ongoing repository of tutorials and workshops
I construct, so expect this to be updated as my research progresses!
